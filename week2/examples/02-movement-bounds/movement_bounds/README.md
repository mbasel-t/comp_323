# Week 2

## New "level"

I added a system where the goal has to be reached 1-3 times (random) for a stage to be completed. When it is reached but the stage has not been completed, it respawns to a new random location.

## New object

The new object I added was a bounce pad, which replaces the teleporter pad when the user is in the platformer mode.

– The object reflects the user's downwards momentum if doing so would result in greater upwards momentum than their jump speed, or otherwise triggers a jump
– It enables the user to use the jump pad to reach higher heights than before, allowing them to reach goals they may have not been able to before
– The player learns to move upwards in more ways

## New mechanic

For the sake of reaching higher heights, I also added the bounce pad's mechanic when the user's field mode is "bounce" and their game mode is "platformer" to more easily enable upwards movement.
