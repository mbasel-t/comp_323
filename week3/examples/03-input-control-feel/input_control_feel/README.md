# Week 3

## How-to-run

* "Nimble" speed preset via button 4
* "Kirby" speed preset via button 5

## "Nimble" speed preset

* Supposed to emulate the opposite of "heavy"
* Blazing-fast start and stop speed
* Jumps are high but execute very quickly
* Differentiates itself from "tight" with higher speed, jump, and gravity, making it feel lighter

## "Kirby" speed preset

* Supposed to be "airy", like Kirby
* Jumps are not super high, but the gravity is very low, so air-time is very high
* Maintains same friction and acceleration as "tight" to make Kirby still feel light
* Surprisingly difficult to actually properly emulate Kirby's movement with these mechanics alone; it appears that Kirby accelerates fast on the way up in his jump so he feels "balloony", but goes down slowy
